# Bankchurn-Project
A Bank Churn Power BI Dashboard is a visual report that helps a bank understand why customers are leaving (churning) their services.
"Churn" means when a customer stops using the bank.
This dashboard is made using Power BI, which is a tool that turns data into easy-to-read charts and graphs.

Key Features:
->Customer Overview: Shows total customers and how many have left.
->Churn Rate: Shows the percentage of customers who stopped using the bank.
->Demographics: Shows which age group, gender, or location is more likely to leave.
->Account Info: Shows how account balance, credit score, or services affect churn.
->Trends: Helps see patterns over time, like which months have higher churn.

Why Itâ€™s Useful:
->Helps the bank understand customer behavior.
->Allows the bank to take action to keep more customers.
->Makes data easy to understand for non-technical people.
